# Note Taker
Application that can be used to write, save, and delete your notes

**Technologies used: Javascript, Node.js, Package.json (Express and UUID) **

-------------------------------

I spent quite a few hours on this assignment. Routing was pretty easy, mostly copy and paste from previous assignments but using a json file as a database had it's challenges. I originally was adding the info but when I restart the server, it would all disappear. I figured out the readFile and writeFile but I feel it was a bit convoluted.

Overall I felt this assignment was challenging, just for the reason of having to figure out the read/writeFile and translating the data of the .json file.
